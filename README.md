Techolution Results is a Swift App that shows a list of Student Results Dashboard and Admission form with validations.

## Requirements

* iOS 10.0+
* Xcode 10.2

##Instalation

###Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)  is an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

## Run iOS Simulator

To build and run your app, use the iOS Simulator app that’s included in Xcode. The simulator gives you an idea of how your app would look and behave if it were running on a device.

The simulator can model a number of different types of hardware—All the screen sizes and resolutions for both iPad and iPhone—so you can simulate your app on every device you’re developing for. In this lesson, use the iPhone 7 option.

#To run your app in the simulator

1.In the Scheme pop-up menu in the Xcode toolbar, choose iPhone 7.

The Scheme pop-up menu lets you choose which simulator or device you’d like to run your app on. Make sure you select the iPhone 7 Simulator, not an iOS device.


2.Click the Run button, located in the top-left corner of the Xcode toolbar.
